### Moderne

Automatically fix, upgrade, and secure code in minutes, not months.

Moderne helps to:
* Update code to use the latest major library and framework versions. Think JUnit 4 to 5, Spring Boot 1 to 2 & 3, Quarkus 1 to 2 & 3, etc.
* Eliminate vulnerable patterns in code. Fix insecure file access, cryptographically insecure random generation, etc.
* Transform code to meet your chosen standards. Auto-fix Checkstyle, adopt Spring or Google Java format, etc.
* Manage large volumes of infrastructure as code. Standardize Kubernetes manifests, patch properties files, etc.
